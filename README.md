# MiniScript Daily Challenges

**Programming is a skill.**  Like any skill, you get better through **practice**.

This site presents a bunch of little programming tasks you can do in MiniScript.  Many of them are meant to be done in Mini Micro or Farmtronics, but others can be done in any MiniScript environment.  Try to **do one task every day**, and your programming prowess will steadily improve.

## Share your success!

You are encouraged to post a screenshot or description of your output (but not the actual code!) to [the MiniScript Discord server](https://discord.gg/7s6zajx), in the `#show-and-tell` channel.  We want to cheer you on!

Remember: **There is no such thing as natural talent.**  "Talented" means nothing more or less than "has more practice than you."  Practice coding every day, and *you* will be a talented coder!
